# XenMobileShell
The XenMobileShell is a PowerShell module that allows easy use of the XenMobile Server API.

Forked from https://github.com/wvanbesien/XenMobileShell

Attempting to follow all official PowerShell coding guidelines and best practies, so learning a lot of new PowerShell related things while doing this. So there will probably be a lot of changes in structure or method along the way.
